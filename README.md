For macOS users:                                                                                                                                                                           
After downloading, if the executable will not open, navigate to your terminal and enter the following: 
1. Navigate to the Executable's Location: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where the executable is located. For example, if your executable is located on the desktop, you can use the following command:                                                                                                                                                         
  cd Desktop (replace Desktop with the location of the executable on your system)
2. Run the Executable: Once in the correct directory, you can run the executable by typing its name and pressing Enter. For example, if your executable is named "Planner.App.macOS," you can run it using:                                                                                                                                                                      
./Planner.App.macOS
3. Provide Execution Permissions (If Needed): If you encounter a "Permission denied" error, you might need to provide execution permissions to the file. You can do this using the chmod command:                                                                                                                                                                                  
chmod +x Planner.App.macOS
4. Run the Executable Again: After setting the execution permissions, you can try running the executable again using the previous command (refer to step 2)                                
NOTE: You may have to run the executable two or three times before it opens up.

For Windows users:                                                                                                                                                                         
If you are experiencing issues opening up the executable file (though this may not be an issue as Windows devices don't have the same level of security restrictions as macOS devices) use these terminal commands:                                                                                             
1. Open the Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Use cd to navigate to the location of the executable file
3. Run the executable file by typing its name and press enter                                                                                                                              
ex.                                                                                                                                                                                        
cd path\to\directory                                                                                                                                                                      
your_app.exe                                                                                                                                                                              

For Linux users:                                                                                                                                                                           
If you are experiencing issues opening up the executable file (though this may not be an issue as Linux devices don't have the same level of security restrictions as macOS devices) use these terminal commands: 
1. Open the terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where your executable file is located using the cd command.
3. Run the executable file by typing ./ followed by the executable's name and pressing Enter.                                                                                              
ex.                                                                                                                                                                                        
cd path/to/directory                                                                                                                                                                      
./your_app                                                                                                                                                                                 
4. If needed, grant permission to open up the executable file. Type in this command:                                                                                                      
chmod +x your_app
